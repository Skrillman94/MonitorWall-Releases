# MonitorWall-Releases
Updates and installation packages are delivered in this repository.

MonitorWall is a Windows desktop application that consolidates multiple information sources and tools into a configurable tile-based dashboard. Each tile can display a website, embedded web content, text notes, or an external Windows application, so monitoring views, work surfaces, and status screens are visible in one place.

The layout is tab-based and fully customizable: tiles can be added, edited, and organized per tab, including a fullscreen view for individual tiles. Configuration and content are stored locally so the dashboard restores to the same state after restart.

Typical use cases include operations and monitoring walls, personal control centers, project cockpits, status boards, runbook notes, and mixed workspaces combining web tools, internal portals, and desktop apps.
